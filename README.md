Inscribe is a **Flutter** mobile application designed for taking notes based on timely friend lexicons. It helps you keep track of important upcoming events, memorable facts, and gift ideas year-round, especially as birthdays approach.

Developed as a Flutter learning project, Inscribe tackles complex concepts and aims to be personally useful, reducing the need for multiple Google Calendar reminders and separate notes. The app adheres to **Clean Architecture Design** and employs **BLOC** for state management, utilizing both Blocs and Cubits for learning purposes, and incorporating the UseCase approach where applicable.

I plan to publish Inscribe on the PlayStore, hoping others will find it as beneficial as I do.
